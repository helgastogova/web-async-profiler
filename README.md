# web-async-profiler [WIP]

# Async Profiler Web Viewer Development Specification
The objective of this project is to develop a web service using the Next.js platform for displaying and analyzing reports generated by [Async Profiler}(https://github.com/async-profiler/async-profiler). The service aims to solve performance issues associated with large reports and provide an intuitive and efficient user interface for data analysis.

# Functional Requirements
* Dynamic Data Loading: Implement a mechanism for the dynamic rendering of reports. Data should load upon user request.
* JSON Report Support: Enable the display and analysis of data in JSON format.
* Frame Graph Visualization: Implement a tool for visualizing frame graphs based on the provided data.
* Filtering and Searching: Offer filtering and searching functionalities within the reports.
* Compatibility with Async Profiler: Ensure seamless integration with Async Profiler, including automatic report generation and analysis.

# Technical Requirements
* Data Types: Utilize the following data structure for JSON report processing:
```
export type JsonDataType = {
  name: string;
  type: number;
  self: number;
  total: number;
  ch: JsonDataType[];
};
```
* Backend and Frontend: Development should be done using Next.js. Use Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for data loading optimization.
* Compatibility: The service should be compatible with web browsers that support ECMAScript 6 and above.
* Testing: Ensure comprehensive code coverage with tests.
* Documentation: Provide complete documentation, including installation and usage instructions.

# Development Phases
